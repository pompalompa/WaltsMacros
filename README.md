Macros for the OCLC Connexion client written by Walter F. Nickeson, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, 14620.

These macros work for me with Connexion client 2.63 and 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise & 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.

The four macrobook files are: Essentials.mbk, Extras1.mbk, Extras2.mbk, and MacroTools.mbk. See the Word .doc file "SharedMacrobooks" for a list of which macros are in each macrobook.

Read a .txt file to see the macro code. Look for the "How it works" section near the top for complete information on how to use the macro and its features.
